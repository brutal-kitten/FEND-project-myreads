You can check it on-line here: https://eloquent-heyrovsky-b347fc.netlify.com

At this project I have been provided the code for a a static example of the CSS and HTML markup for MyReads app. I've made this app interactive. User can see books stored at three shelfs: Read, Want To Read and Currently Reading. Also User can change the shelf for each book and this book will move to the respective shelf. User can search for new book, then pick a book from result and move it to one of thee shelfs.
